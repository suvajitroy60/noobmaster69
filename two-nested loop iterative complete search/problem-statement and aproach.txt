Find and display all pairs of 5-digit numbers that collectively use the digits 0 through 9 
once each,such that the first number when divided by the second number is equal to integer
N, where 2<=N<=79.

Input:
N(2<=N<=79)

Output:
Pair of 5 digit numbers a and b in which no digits are repeated such that a/b=N

sample input:
N=62
output:
79546 01283
94736 01528
Note that no digits are repeated in any number.Suppose,If the first number contains digit 9
then it should not be present in the second number.

Approach:

the format is a/b=N
Quick analysis shows that the number b can range from 01234 to 98765.
An even better bound for b is the range from 01234 to 98765/N
For each b, we can find a=b*N
Now we have to check that a and b together contains all the 10 digits(0 to 9)
Iterative Complete search approach with two nested loops is done.
